# # USSPM Common Chemical Compond Lookup Table Utils
# Utility script to lookup synonyms of common chemical compounds as extracted fom the following Wikipedia entries:
# - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chemical_formulae
# - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CAS_numbers_by_chemical_compound
# 
# 
# From prediction analysis we found that most models we trained had difficulties in predictng the score for phrase containing chemical formulae. We hence introduce a lookup table to find synonyms for common chemical compounds based on their formulae. 
# 
# Since phrases in the USPPPM training are lower-cased, chemical formulas might be abigous and are hard to determine directly. Furthermore, chemical formulas might spell actual words. For example the string `base` can be interpreded as a word (e.g. as in *military base*) or as the chemical compound *barium selenide*. 
# Since replacing the actual word with the name of a chemical compound would likely produce wrong samples, we need a strategy for which strings to replace when they match a certain formula. Here we use three heuristics:
# 1. A manually curated blacklist of phrases to not replace
# 2. A pattern based whiteiist where we replace all strings that contain numbers
# 3. A final blacklist using a lookup into the wordnet database. If we find a synset there, we assume that the string is a commonly used word that most large Language Models can work with properly.

# ### USPPPM Dataset Augmentation
# Utility functions to augment a USPPPM datasets with samples generated from replacing common chemical formulae in *anchor* and *target* phrases with their corresponding synonyms.
# 
# This can either be used for training by augment the dataset with additional samples to train on and/or at inference time, by averaging predictions of additional augmented samples
